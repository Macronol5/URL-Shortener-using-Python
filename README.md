# URL-Shortener-using-Python

Python makes it easy to do anything in IT field.

Today we will use Python to short any URL.

We will be using “pyshorteners” module from Python.

You can install by typing "pip install pyshorteners" inside terminal.

There is nothing big to explain here, as Python makes most of the code too short and the same is here.

We are using "pyshorteners" which shorts any URL we give to the program.
